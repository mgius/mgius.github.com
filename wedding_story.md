# Our Story

The say "absence makes the heart grow fonder..." well, there must be some truth
in that, because after living thousands of miles apart for over half of their
relationship, Tracy and Mark are getting married!

Tracy and Mark started flirting at Cal Poly in fall 2009 when they had Musical
Theater History together. They also say "music is the food of love," remember?
Mark recognized Tracy's incredible hair and decided to sit next to it... and
her. At the end of the quarter, Mark asked her out and the rest is history...
a very complicated, travel-heavy history.

Since then, they have rarely lived within 20 miles of each other. First, Tracy
went to San Diego for a summer internship in 2010.  Then, having decided you
can never go too far, she studied abroad in Germany for the last two quarters
of her undergrad degree. Not to be outdone by Tracy, Mark accepted a job and
moved to Seattle by the time Tracy returned. Tracy, of course, had already
accepted a job in San Diego. 

They somehow both managed to graduate from Cal Poly in 2011 and continue their
loving relationship until (finally) in Sept 2012, after almost two years of
relating a la long distance, Tracy moved to Seattle to start Graduate School at
Seattle University. This made Mark (and more importantly Tracy’s friend, Megan)
very, very happy! So happy, in fact, that he proposed to her one year later
&#9786;
