# Ceremony 

The Ceremony starts at 4:00 pm at the 
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5gSsp">Redondo Beach Historical Library</a>.
Complimentary valet parking is available beginning at 3:30PM located in the
driveway for the venue (see map below).

# Getting There

Getting to the venue can be slightly tricky. Please find walking directions
from the Crowne Plaza to the venue
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GSOlb">right here</a>.

Please see the highlighted driving route below for directions to the venue's
provided valet parking. The driveway heading into the venue can be somewhat
confusing. If you find yourself underneath the Pier, you've taken a wrong turn.
